NOTE: This project has been abandoned. I am using the pi for a different project so the site is no longer updated

- Uses a cron job on a Raspberry Pi to check lane closures sent to my gmail and posts to a Firebase DB with the latest updates
- Updates are consumed by the FE and parsed for human readability
- Allows for selection of different SCDOT traffic cameras at the top of the Don Holt bridge to guage commute time
